# cse_120_pa3_tests
Before you start, it's a good time to
BACKUP YOUR CODE!

Comment out the entire Main() function in your pa3d.c (Not a good practice, but whatever..)

Copy the Makefile and the whole Tests direcotry into your pa3 directory.

Run "make test".

Then tests t1-8 should be generated.

Don't forget to uncomment the Main() in your pa3d.c after you're done testing.
